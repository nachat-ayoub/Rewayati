## About this project:
Rewayati is a light novel website created with two versions: Next.js(nextjs branch) and Sveltekit(master branch). It serves as a platform for reading **Arabaic** translated light novels. The project was completed within a period of two weeks. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nachat-ayoub/Rewayati), and you can explore the live demo [here](https://rewayati.vercel.app/), but unfortunately it's not working right now due to the API being down because of heroku.
