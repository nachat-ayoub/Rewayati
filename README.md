# Rewayati - Light Novel Website

## About this project:
Rewayati is a light novel website created with two versions: Next.js (nextjs branch) and Sveltekit (master branch). It serves as a platform for reading **Arabic** translated light novels. The project was completed within a period of two weeks. The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nachat-ayoub/Rewayati), and you can explore the live demo [here](https://rewayati.vercel.app/), but unfortunately, it's not working right now due to the API being down because of Heroku.

## Technologies used:
- Next.js
- Sveltekit
- Tailwind CSS
